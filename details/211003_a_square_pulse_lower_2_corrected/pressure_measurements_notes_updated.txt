Notes pressure measurements

All pressures in [bar gauge] and temperature in [Celcius]

All transducers were zeroed (i.e. showing 0.00 barg ahead of injections) 
 
Note that some ports have multiple pressure transducers, stated in name 
The range of each pressure transducer is listed in the heading (e.g. 0-2.5 bar)

Accuracy (NLHR) Â±0.15% of span BFSL (NLHR = non-linearity, hysteresis and repeatability; BFSL = Best Fit Straight Line)

Pressure measurement times vs injection times
Day 1
Welltest port (17,7): pressure logging started 4:54pm;injection started 5:19pm
Welltest 1 port (9,3): pressure logging started 8:47pm; injection started 8:52pm

Next day
Welltest 2 port (9,3): pressure logging started 2:29pm; injection started 2:48pm
